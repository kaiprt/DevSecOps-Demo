# DevSecOps-Demo
This repository is used as an open source demonstration of Moonrake's DevSecOps capabilities.

## Issue Tracking
Issues can be tracked in the [issues tab](https://github.com/MoonrakeOpen/DevSecOps-Demo/issues) in this GitHub repository. We have an internal repository for most of our work but we have found the features of GitHub to be easier for this open source project since the project is already made public. You can take a look at upcoming tasks and features in the [projects](https://github.com/MoonrakeOpen/DevSecOps-Demo/projects) section. of the repository.

## Git Strategy
We are using a combination of the forking strategy which is common among open-source projects in combination with the GitFlow workflow.
